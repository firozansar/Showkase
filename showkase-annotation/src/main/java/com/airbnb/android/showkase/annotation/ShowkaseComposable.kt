package com.airbnb.android.showkase.annotation

/**
 * Used to annotate @Composable functions that should be displayed inside the
 * Showkase browser. Here's how you would use it with your @Composable function:
 *
 * @ShowkaseComposable(name = "Name", group = "Group")
 * @Composable
 * fun MyComposable() {
 *     .......
 *     .......
 * }
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: Make sure that you add this annotation to only those functions that don't accept any
 * parameters. If your function accepts a parameters, wrap it inside another  function that doesn't
 * accept any parameters.
 *
 * For example, here is a @Composable function that requires parameters -
 *
 * @Composable
 * fun MyComposable(name: String) {
 *     .......
 *     .......
 * }
 *
 * In order to make this function compatible with Showkase, you could further wrap this function
 * inside a method that doesn't accept a parameters in the following way:
 *
 * @ShowkaseComposable(name = "Name", group = "Group")
 * @Composable
 * fun MyComposablePreview() {
 *     MyComposable("Name")
 * }
 *
 * This requirement is even needed by the @Preview functions of Jetpack Compose.
 *
 * @param name The name that should be used to describe your `@Composable` function. If you don't
 * pass any value, the name of the composable function is used as the name.
 * @param group The grouping key that will be used to group it with other `@Composable` functions
 * . This is useful for better organization and discoverability of your components. If you don't
 * pass any value for the group, the name of the class that wraps this function is used as the
 * group name. If the function is a top level function, the composable is added to a "Default Group".
 * @param widthDp The width that your component will be rendered in inside the Showkase browser.
 * Use this to restrict the size of your preview inside the Showkase browser.
 * @param heightDp The height that your component will be rendered in inside the Showkase browser.
 * Use this to restrict the size of your preview inside the Showkase browser.
 * @param skip Use this boolean when you want to skip this composable from the Showkase browser. A
 * use case of this might be when you want a composable that's annotated with @Preview to show previews
 * in Android Studio but don't want to necessary show it in the component browser that's autogenerated
 * by Showkase
 * @param defaultStyle Used to represent a composable function is the default style variant of a given
 * composable. More information on how Showkase allows you to represent component styles in this section -
 * https://github.com/airbnb/Showkase#representing-component-styles-in-showkase
 * @param tags Various string values that will be propagated to the Showkase browser to allow additional
 * filtering or categorization.
 * @param extraMetadata Various string values that are **not** used by the standard Showkase browser
 * but are still available in the generated `ShowkaseBrowserComponent` object. This may be useful when
 * extra data is needed for attributing components during other processes (e.g. static analysis,
 * displaying attributions in a custom component browser).
